This is the code we have used to practice Fucntions.
The Terraform language includes a number of built-in functions that you can call from within expressions to transform and combine values. The general syntax for function calls is a function name followed by comma-separated arguments in parentheses.
The Terraform language does not support user-defined functions, and so only the functions built in to the language are available for use. The documentation includes a page for all of the available built-in functions.
